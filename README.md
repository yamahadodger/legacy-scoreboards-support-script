# Legacy Scoreboards Support Script
Fix for HUDs (scoreboards precisely) made before Tough Break Update.

**What it does exactly?**
Simply disables 3D character model in scoreboard while keeping it on in HUDPlayerClass (when playing, with scoreboard disabled).

You can also disable 3D model entirely by following the `How to use?` section below.

# How to use?
To utilize the config entirely, make sure to download all config files.

You can put certain files to [.ignore](https://github.com/yamahadodger/legacy-scoreboards-support-script/tree/master/yamahadodger/sbo/.ignore) folder to blacklist them. To only use the standard old scoreboard, you can drag files labeled as `*2.cfg` to [.ignore](https://github.com/yamahadodger/legacy-scoreboards-support-script/tree/master/yamahadodger/sbo/.ignore) folder. After that, you can reload the configuration by using `sbo.reload` to utilize the standard old scoreboard.

It's the best to use it with this launch parameter: +exec yamahadodger/sbo
