# Legacy Scoreboards Support Script
Fix for HUDs (scoreboards precisely) made before Tough Break Update.

**What it does exactly?**
Simply disables 3D character model in scoreboard while keeping it on in HUDPlayerClass (when playing, with scoreboard disabled).

You can also disable 3D model entirely by simply moving/deleting sbo_script.cfg file.
