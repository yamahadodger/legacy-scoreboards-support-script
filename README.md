# Legacy Scoreboards Support Script
Fix for HUDs (scoreboards precisely) made before Tough Break Update.

What it does exactly?
Simply disables 3D character model in scoreboard while keeping it on in HUDPlayerClass (when playing, with scoreboard disabled).

You can also disable 3D model entirely by simply moving/deleting sbo_script.cfg file.
