# Legacy Scoreboards Support Script
A fix for older HUDs' scoreboards which were made before Tough Break Update.

# What it does exactly?
It disables 3D character model in scoreboard while keeping it on in HUDPlayerClass (when playing, with scoreboard disabled).

You can also disable 3D model entirely by following the `How to use it?` section below.

# How to use it?
To utilize the config entirely, make sure to download all config files.

To make this config function, use the following game launch parameter: `+exec yamahadodger/sbo`

You can exclude certain files from execution by commenting them out. To disable 3D model entirely, edit the [sbo.cfg](https://github.com/yamahadodger/legacy-scoreboards-support-script/blob/master/yamahadodger/sbo.cfg) file then comment out the line: `exec yamahadodger/sbo/conf2`

The 3D model should be gone and the config is ready to be reloaded. To reload the config, type in the game console prompt: `sbo.reload`
